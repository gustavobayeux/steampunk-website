## Why i made it
Coding is art, i was tired of making bland corporate-looking websites. 
DifferTopia represents this state of art whereas pure CSS brings, to the viewer a real, authentic, experience.

In this source-code you will find the most mind-blowing and yet simple techniques i used, back in 2023, to
code this website outta pure Front-end technologies. 

Front-end development, for me, is like yarning, i get into flow and get it done! the crazier the design the better.
